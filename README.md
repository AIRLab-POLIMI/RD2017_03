Hermit Crab is an autonomous Arduino based robot which can interact with people in order to promote a fish restaurant.
Our idea is to build more than one robot with the appearance of hermit crabs that will be able to move, to understand when a person is approaching them and to react hiding under their own shells.
Then they will start slowly to come out from the shell and start to do some movements attracting attention with sound and light.
